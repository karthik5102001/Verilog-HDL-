1: Good prectice is to stabalize the output befor clock hits high or low, this is the part of STA(static Timing Analysis) it can cause a indetermined state wether the Flip-flop or other gates have changed or not. Even worse, the flip flop may malfunction and output a short pulse or even go into oscillation.

2 : Flip-flop typically have a setup time (Stabalize time) abuot 3-10x of propogation delay, Hold time is typically 1-2x of delay.
